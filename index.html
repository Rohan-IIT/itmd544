    <p>I'm Rohan. I'm thrilled to be part of this class and embark on
            a web development journey with all of you. I'm currently a master's
            student in my second semester, and I've eagerly enrolled in this
            course to expand my knowledge and skills in web development. My
            journey into web development began with a strong passion for
            creating interactive and user-friendly websites. In my prior
            experiences, I've had the opportunity to work on various web
            projects, which have provided me with a good overview of HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and other essential web technologies.</p>
